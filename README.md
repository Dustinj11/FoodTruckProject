# FoodTruckProject

// in this food truck project the goal was to accomplish all the user stories
// and ensure the grading scale can be conducted.

// the hardest part for me in this project and with really everything in this
// course is just getting started. It is difficult for me to form something
// out of nothing. I constantly have to google examples in order to find a
// starting point. It gets frustrating at times because i feel like i am
// 10 steps behind everyone.

// lessons learned were do not over think things. Sometimes going back to the
// basics will help you get through problems. I had to watch basic fundamental
// youtube videos, and go back to previous drills in order to gain a better
// of what needed to be done.

// With this project I gained more of an understanding of for loops and arrays.
// these were two of the most used basic fundamentals used throughout the entire
// project. I still do not have a full grasp on methods, the not using a static
// method through me off for a little in the beginning. Methods are something i
// constantly have to review every time i start a project.
// I also gained a greater understanding of nesting loops within loops. Before
// this project i could not wrap my brain around loops inside of loops. This
// project has caused me to thing differently than I normally do. 

// another lesson learned is in my opinion this job can not be done by yourself.
// This is 100% a team effort when it comes to getting things done.
// Lucas, Desiree, and Julian helped me tremendously with this project.

// Was this project fun? It was stressful... I still feel like i have NO IDEA
// what I am doing. Advice from other is to process the process and understand
// that everyone felt as if they were drowning in the beginning.
